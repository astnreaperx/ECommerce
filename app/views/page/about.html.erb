    <label for="name">Description</label>
    <p>We are new here to the digital woodworking game, but we have high hopes and a high
     ambition to change that. Woodworking is one of those industries that has been around
     forever and the business model has not changed. That is where we come in, we want to
     change the traditional model to a semi-traditional model. We still strive for that traditional
      quality but are delivered in a streamlined, efficient, and convenient way. The
      traditional method tends to be slow and very expensive, our model will hope to eliminate
       the downsides of the traditional model.</p>
